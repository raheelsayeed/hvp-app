A chest x-ray obtained to evaluate for pneumonia shows a lung nodule, bilateral interstitial markings but no consolidation. After transfer out of the ICU, the patient has a follow up CT with contrast that showed improvement of the interstitial edema and reconfirms a single 2.5 cm nodule; the radiology report suggests either biopsy or repeat imaging in three months. \n\nThe course is further complicated by the development of a DVT, which requires a heparin drip with transition to apixaban, as well as respiratory failure requiring intubation. Despite a prolonged hospital course – 57 days  – the patient gradually recovers. The patient is severely deconditioned, and rehabilitation is recommended.\n\nOn the day of discharge – 54 days after the lung nodule is discovered – the patient is preparing for discharge.
